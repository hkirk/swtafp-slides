### Agenda

* Problem
* IO
* Ports & Adapters
* Abstraction
* Other

---

### Problem


![Classic 3 layer architecture](./img/3layer.png)

Note:

Breaks DIP - BLL depends on details in DAL

----

#### Small change

So to adhere to DIP

![Updated 3 layer architecture](./img/3layer2.png)

----

#### Why keep BLL pure

* Creating a PDF invoice, requires
    * Products
    * Prices before and after taxes
    * Custumer information
    * Date
    * Invoice number

----

#### OOP way of doing this

```csharp
public void GenerateInvoice(Order order, Customer customer)
{
    // ...
}
```

* Testing
    * requires us to compare files
    * But what about date and invoice number?

----

#### Handling internalization

```csharp
public void GenerateInvoice(Order order,
             Customer customer, Language lang) {}
```

Call `GenerateInvoice` twice on for each language - what problems does this introduce?

![Invoice-lang](./img/invoice-lang.png)

----

#### Problems

So each call to `GeneateInvoice` increments invoice number :(

----

#### Solution

---

## IO

* IO is from Haskell
* Used to force inpure code away from pure code
* Baked in to type system

----

### Monad

So IO would be all the places we have side-effects aka. Infrastructure

* IO is a monad.
* Another example of monads is F#'s `Option`
* Monads can be combined with '`bind`'

**Note**: We will come back to monads.

----

#### Return and Bind

Two important methods are '`return`' and '`bind`'

```fsharp
val return: 'a -> M<'a>
val bind:   M<'a> -> (a -> M<'b>) -> M<'b>
```


note: 

Monads also have some rules

----

#### Example with F#'s Option

```fsharp
let o = Some 3 // creation
let n = None   // creation 
let f = fun a -> Some (a+3)

o |> Option.bind f // ...
n |> Option.bind f // ...
```

---

#### Hexagonal architecture

also known as Ports and Adapters

![Hexagonal Architeture](./img/Hexagonal_Architecture.png "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)") <!-- .element style="height:400px" -->

By Alistair Cockburn 

----

## Ports & Adapters

* Components
    * loosely coupled and interchangeable
    * e.g. database, ui, business logic, etc. etc.
* Ports
    * 'holes' that components can access other components through
* Adapters
    * glue between components and ports

Note: Not only for FP - but very used especially in FP so e.g. F# and Haskell

----

### A Resturant example

* Resturant check if reservation can be accepted


```fsharp
let connStr = "..."
let reserveTable = 
    Validate.reservation
    >> bind (Capacity.check 10 (getReservedSeatsFromDb connStr))
    >> map (saveReservation connStr) // same as below
  //>> map (fun res -> (saveReservation connStr) res)
```

----

### Closer look at `Capacity.Check`

```fsharp
type Error = CapacityExceeded
type Reservation = {Quantity: int}

let check capacity getReservedSeats reservation =
    let reservedSeats = getReservedSeats reservation
    if (capacity < reservation.Quantity + reservedSeats)
    then Result.Error CapacityExceeded
    else Result.Ok reservation
// val check :
//  capacity:int ->
//  getReservedSeats:(Reservation -> int) ->
//  reservation:Reservation -> Result<Reservation,Error>
```

----

### Inject `getReservedSeats`

```fsharp
let getReservedSeatsFromDb (connStr: string)
                           (reservations: Reservation): int = 
    failwith "Not implemented"

let getReservedSeats = getReservedSeatsFromDb connStr
// val getReservedSeats : (Reservation -> int)
```

So '`getReservedSeats`' are inpure - but that do not show in the signature.

----

### 'Problem'

* Our pure function '`check`', will be inpure in production

* But why do checkCapacity need getReservedSeats at all?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

### Rewrite

```fsharp
let check capacity reservedSeats reservation =
    if (capacity < reservation.Quantity + reservedSeats)
    then Result.Error CapacityExceeded
    else Result.Ok reservation
```

----

### Calling check

So now calling '`check`' is a bit more tedious

```fsharp
let connStr = ".."
let reserveTable =
  Validate.reservation
    >> map  (fun r -> (getReservedSeatsFromDb connStr r, r))
    >> bind (fun (i, r) -> Capacity.check 10 i r)
    >> map  (saveReservation connStr)
  //>> map (fun r -> saveReservation connStr r)
```

Note:

`>>` function composition

```
let (>>) f g x = g (f x)

let add1 x = 1+x
let times2 x = x*2

let add1Times2 = (>>) add1 times2
let add1Times2' = add1 >> times2
```

----

### Reuse logic

* What is business logic?
* What is application logic?
* Should `reserveTable` belong in the business logic layer? 

----

The function `reserveTable`
1. could also argue that this function is part of the controller
2. thereby not something you would reuse in another application
3. because:
    * would you always need to handle resevation validation?
    * handle input/output different

----

### Generalization

1. Read data from impure sources
2. Hand data to BLL
3. Use returned data to perform side-effects

---

## Abstractions

* Pure functions
* Impure functions

----

### Calling functions

1. Pure functions **may** call other pure functions
2. Impure functions **may** call other impure functions
3. Impure functions **may** call other pure functions
4. ~~Pure functions **may not** call other impure functions~~

----

### ??

Is my function `a` pure or not?

----

### Hexagonal architecture

* To avoid DAL to contaminate e.g. BLL
* Alternative to layered architecture
* Each component is connected through a number of ports


**Note**: Not always the correct solution

----

### Onion architecture

![Onion architecture](./img/onion-architecture.png) <!-- .element style="height: 260px" -->

* Onion architecture was inspired by Hexogonal architecture
* Layered architecture
    * where inner circles have no knowledge of outer circle


----

### Onion pro/cons

* \- e.g. database is accessible from UI
    * they are in same layer - not a good idea though.
* \+ fewer artifacts then ports and adapters

---

### Broker architecture

![Broker architecture](./img/broker-architecture.png "https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Broker-architectural-pattern_fig2_330079838")

Looks like microservices, right?

----

### Pipe and filter

![Pipe and Filter](./img/pipe-and-filter.jpg "https://csblogpro.wordpress.com/2017/11/05/pipe-and-filter-architecture/")

note:

We will take a closer look at this later
